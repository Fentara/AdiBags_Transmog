AdiBags_Transmog
================

This is an AdiBags plugin that organizes your bags with
two new categories.

### Visuals
All gear that has a visual you have not collected for the current character.

### Account visuals
All gear that is a missing visual that is possible to
send to another character on your account. (BoA, BoE)

**NB:** No check is done if you actually have a usable character
for this.

## Options
In addition there is an option to include visuals that you have collected but not from
this item (for completionists).

## Translations
So far I only support english texts, the filter itself is based on client translations
and should work but the menu and tooltip texts are english only.
Any input on translations is appreciated.
