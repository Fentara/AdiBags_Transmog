AdiBags_Transmog is an AdiBags plugin that organizes your bags with
two new categories:

Visuals:         All gear that has a visual you have not collected for 
                 the current character.

Account visuals: All gear that is a missing visual that is possible to
                 send to another character on your account. (BoA, BoE)
                 NB: No check is done if you actually have a usable character
                 for this.

In addition there is an option to include visuals that you have collected but not from
this item (for completionists).
